A Turtle is a special sprite that can move around the screen and make drawings.  The turtle's movements will be animated so that you can see it's movements.

A turtle object includes all of the movement methods of a [Sprite]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _classes/sprite.md %}) and the drawing methods of a [Painter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _classes/painter.md %}).
